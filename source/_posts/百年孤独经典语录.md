1. The secret of a happy old age is nothing else but a decent agreement with loneliness.

   一个幸福的晚年的秘诀不是别的，而是与孤寂签订一个体面的协定。

   

2. Only when the mist on my heart is washed away with water will glory illuminate the original dream.

   只有用水将心上的雾气淘洗干净，荣光才会照亮最初的梦想。

   

3. All the splendor that once experienced in life must be paid back with loneliness.

   生命中曾经经历过的所有绚烂，终究都要用寂寞来偿还。

   

4. The original time will also be wrong and unexpected, and thus burst, leaving an eternal fragment in a room.

   原来时间也会失误和出现意外，并因此迸裂，在某个房间里留下永恒的片段。

5. Even if we think our feelings are too dry to give, there will always be a moment when something can touch the strings in our hearts. After all, we are not born to enjoy loneliness.

   即使以为自己的感情已经干涸得无法给予，也总会有一个时刻一样东西能拨动心灵深处的弦，我们毕竟不是生来就享受孤独的。

   

6. Once upon a time when God didn't cheat, everything was different. Now, not only do children grow up very fast, but also people's feeling is not like before.

   从前上帝不骗人的时候，一切都是不同的。现在呢，不仅孩子们长的很快，甚至人的感觉也不象以前那样了。

   

7. No matter where you go, you should always remember: the past is false, the past can not be returned, and every disappearing spring is gone forever. The most fanatical, most faithful love is just passing away.

   不管走到哪，都要永远记住：过去是虚假的，往事时不能返回的，每一个消逝的春天都一去不复返了。最狂热、最坚贞的爱情也只是过眼云烟。

8. The most terrible thing about insomnia is not that people can't sleep without tiredness; it will irreversibly deteriorate to a more serious situation: forgetting.

   失眠的最可怕之处，不在于让人毫无倦意不能入睡；而是会不可逆转地恶化到更严重的境地：遗忘。

   

9. Don't beg anyone. Don't kowtow in front of others. You just think that someone else shot me.

   不要恳求任何人，不要在别人面前卑躬屈节。你就当别人早就把我枪毙了。

   

10. I just feel that people's inner pain can't be expressed, and many of people's actions can't be done. One hundred years of understanding, one hundred years of loneliness.

    只是觉得人的内心苦楚无法言说，人的很多举措无可奈何，百年一参透，百年一孤寂。
